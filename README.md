### Hi there, I'm Ken 👋

### Some info on me...🙃 

I am advocate and enthusiast for open-source, blockchain technology, open finance, and being a good person ✌️

I'm not a great coder (yet...), so I currently work as a Technical Sourcer at OpenSea and run a talent consultancy sharing web3 job alpha 🤝  

When I'm not emailing you about a new job, I'm reading through project documentation looking for the next big thing, attending the latest ETH conference, yield farming, or out on a run with my Australian Shepherd 🐶

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to better understand Rust and Solidity
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything in the Polkadot or Ethereum ecosystem 
- 💬 Ask me about what roles I'm hiring for at OpenSea
- 📫 How to reach me: ken.cadima@opensea.io
