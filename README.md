### About me 

An advocate for open-source, web3, and democratizing finance 👐

Code when I can to understand what's happening under the hood the tech I'm a proponent for. Currently working as a Technical Recruiter at OpenSea and run a talent firm sharing web3 job alpha 🤝  

When I'm not dm'ing you about a job, I'm reading through project documentation, attending an ETH conference, yield farming, or out on a run with my Australian Shepherd 🐶

- 🐇🕳️ Rabbit holes I'm in... EIPs, intents, account abstraction, Solidity 
- 👯 Open to hearing about collaborating on anything in the Ethereum ecosystem 
- 💬 Ask me about job alpha at OpenSea
