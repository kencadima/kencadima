### Hi there, I'm Ken 👋

### Some info on me...🙃 

I am advocate for and enthusiast of open-source, web3 technology, open finance, and being a good person ✌️

I'm not a great coder, but do what I can to understand what's happening under the hood of bleeding edge tech. I currently work as a Technical Sourcer at OpenSea and run a talent consultancy sharing web3 job alpha 🤝  

When I'm not dm'ing you about a job, I'm reading through project documentation looking for the next big thing, attending the latest ETH conference, yield farming, or out on a run with my Australian Shepherd 🐶

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to better understand the inner workings of Solidity, Cairo, and how smart contracts are optimized without any security tradeoffs
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything in the Polkadot or Ethereum ecosystem 
- 💬 Ask me about job alpha at OpenSea
- 📫 How to reach me: ken.cadima@opensea.io
